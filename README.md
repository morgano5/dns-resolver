# DNS Resolver

A Java DNS resolver.

This is still under construction. Basic functionality is already there but there are some issues to fix.

## TODO list

* Restart queries when a CNAME RR is reached
* Support for other RRs specified in DNS updates and extensions
* Support for MAILB, AXFR and other possible queries returning more than one type of RR

## To consider

* Support classes other than IN
* Support inverse queries
